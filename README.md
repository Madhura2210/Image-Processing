I am trying to work with image processing libraries in python. The objective is to understand image processing in deep from scratch.
Technologies used are python, cv2, numpy and I am coding entirely in jupyter notebook.
## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
3. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook
